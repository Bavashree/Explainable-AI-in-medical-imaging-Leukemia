# Explainable-AI-in-medical-imaging-Leukemia

This project aims to develop a reliable and interpretable AI model for accurate leukemia diagnosis using medical images of blood cells. The model will focus on providing clear and comprehensible explanations for each prediction, enhancing trust and understanding among healthcare providers. Additionally, it will generate counterfactual explanations to rule out alternative diagnoses by presenting what-if scenarios, improving the diagnostic decision-making process. To support the AI model, a comprehensive database will be built, incorporating patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory test results to enhance context awareness and diagnostic accuracy. The AI will also predict treatment outcomes based on patient-specific data, offering personalized treatment plans and prognostic insights. This approach aims to bridge the gap between complex AI decisions and clinical comprehension, ensuring that the model is accessible and usable for all healthcare providers. By integrating explainable AI with comprehensive patient data, the study seeks to improve leukemia diagnosis accuracy, support personalized treatment plans, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes and healthcare provider confidence in AI-assisted diagnostics.
